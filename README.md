# Arch-Linux-Scripts

Notes

All these files are invisible (. prefix). Most are immediately obvious.

.pmat calls .pmatrix.py, which is a fun little toy I wrote

.mvlinux, .installlinux, and .syncwc are general purpose config/theme
backup and restore tools. They should work on your system, with a few
quick tweaks, and they greatly reduce the labor of maintaining multiple
Arch installations
